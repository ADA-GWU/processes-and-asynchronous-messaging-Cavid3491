This is my attempt of Assignment 2 for Distributed Systems class.
I am trying to farm commits for now and figuring out how to handle this assignment.
Admittedly, it is not going well yet. I am trying to work on it but I have to prepare for the midterm.

Update, 27.10.23, 20:40, next to D107:
I suppose I have solved the 80% part with the given credentials as evidenced by the logs I have uploaded. I might try the 100% part and delete 80%.
